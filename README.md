# Angular Workshop

This repo holds the content needed for learning the basics of angular.

The `/start` subdirectory is the application before any dynamic content is added. This
is meant for the student to begin with and add angular code/markup.

Each "step" will be outlined here and one solution to the step will be in subsequent step directories.

# Dependencies

Since this is meant to be done in a workshop environment where internet connectivity is not guaranteed,
all dependencies are committed into the `/lib` subdirectory.

The app itself is meant to run without any internet requirement.

* `angular.js` - v1.3.8 (unminified)
* `bootstrap.min.css` - v3.3
